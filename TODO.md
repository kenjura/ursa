# Basic Functionality

- [x] Enable static assets from meta in build (perhaps by copying them?)
- [x] Enable static assets from source in build
- [ ] Handle menus at different levels
- [x] Add a live-serve command that translates from source in real time (for testing)
- [ ] Deal with crashes when no menu file is found
