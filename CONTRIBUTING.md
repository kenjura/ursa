# Format

All contributions must meet these requirements:
- Increment the version number in package.json
- Add a CHANGELOG entry for the new version
- Add an annotated tag, e.g.: `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"`
- Push the changes and tags with `git push --follow-tags`

And, you know, common sense stuff like good commit messages and test coverage (lol).
